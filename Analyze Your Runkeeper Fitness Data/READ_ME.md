# Analyze-Your-Runkeeper-Fitness-Data
## Project Description


With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data with gadgets to keep themselves motivated.

They look for answers to questions as following:
1.	How fast, long, and intense was my run today?
2.	Have I succeeded with my training goals?
3.	Am I progressing?
4.	What were my best achievements?
5.	How do I perform compared to others?

I have analyzed the seven years worth of data-owner's training data from Runkeeper. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. In this project, I created import, clean, and analyze this data to answer the above questions. Everyone can then apply the same strategy to the training data if you wish!
